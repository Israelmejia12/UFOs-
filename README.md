Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The purpose of this analysis is to explain how my UFO website works and how it works. In the image below you can see a copu of the website. and a brief descreption of UFO sigtins around the world. On the botton left of the website there are filters that can help navigate through the website and in the bottom right you can find the data.

This new webpage can be a powerful tool, as it can help someone interested in UFO see where UFO sightings have been spotted around the country, the date, and the shape of the UFO.
Summary: In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.
One drawback in the design of the website is that once someone does a search, they would have to reset the webpage in order to get the table to repopule. I find this to be both time consuming an annoying. I believe that in order to help viewers we would need to edit our code and make it possible for the table to refresh itself after the filter has been clear.
